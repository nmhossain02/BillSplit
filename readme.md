# Payflow

#### _A direct consumer to merchant bill-splitting app using the NCR Orders API_

## Inspiration

A few days ago, a couple of friends and I spent 20 minutes trying to order at a restaurant. Most of the time was spent discussing which order each person would pay. What we ended up doing was having my friend Nabeel pay the whole amount while the rest of us venomed him regarding the items that we order. Nabeel had to pay the full $75 dollars for our order just so that we could claim each individual dish we bought. Having gone through this process, we decided to create Payflow that would allow consumers in grocery lines shopping together to split the final bill seen on the cashier.

## What it does

Unlike the restaurant experience, pay flow would allow consumers to join a web server containing the items in the cart, select each item according to each consumer, calculate the total cost for each consumer, and most importantly *directly pay the merchant through the NCR Orders API*

## How we built it
- Flask for the back end
- HTML, javascript, CSS for the front end
- Processing orders by connecting to the NCR Orders API

## Challenges we ran into
- Trying to learn too many technologies at once
- Not knowing the functions that make our code more readable and efficient
- Having to pivot our idea 4 times

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Learning flask and using the NCR API
- Submitting a project for our first hackathon
- Pushing through despite being sleep deprived

## What we learned
- Ideation framework
- Asking questions to mentors really helped
- How to work on a full-stack project

## What's next for Payflow
- Implementation in the NCR POS systems!
